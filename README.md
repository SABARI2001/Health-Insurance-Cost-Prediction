# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

# Objective

Medical expenses are difficult to estimate because the most costly conditions are rare and seemingly random. Still, some conditions are more prevalent for certain segments of the population. For instance, lung cancer is more likely among smokers than non-smokers, and heart disease may be more likely among the obese. The goal of this project is to use patient data to estimate the average medical care expenses using regression for provided population segments
